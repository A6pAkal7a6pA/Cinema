is told out of 
chronological order, and 
follows three main 
interrelated stories that 
each have a different 
protagonist: Vincent Vega, 
a hitman; Butch Coolidge, 
a prizefighter; and Jules 
Winnfield, Vincent's 
partner.[10]

The film begins with a 
diner hold-up staged by a 
couple, then begins to 
shift from one storyline 
to another before 
returning to the diner for 
the conclusion.
