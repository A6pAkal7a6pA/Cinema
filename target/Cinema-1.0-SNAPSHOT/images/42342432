Garfield is an overweight, 
lazy and free-spirited 
orange cat who lives with 
his owner Jon Arbuckle. 
Garfield passes his time 
by antagonizing Jon and 
teasing his aggressive 
neighbor, Luca the 
Doberman. Aside from Jon, 
Garfield maintains an 
unlikely friendship with a 
helpful mouse, Louis. 
Garfield also socializes 
with his fellow 
neighborhood cats, Nermal 
and Arlene.
